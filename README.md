This project use modified BERT model to classify startups based on their description text and other financial data<br/>
<br/>
The main research contents of this paper include encoding, fine-tuning training and classification, first of all, this paper uses “one-hot” coding method to encode all kinds of information, secondly, through fine-tuning training to adjust the BERT model part, so that it can encode the company introduction text, and finally, all the encoding in the above is combined and classified. The research in this paper shows that it is better to use multiple sources of information to judge the success of a start-up than to consider a single-dimensional information model.
